RemoteUser authentication for Cascade
=====================================

The RemoteUser authentication module lets you use various web server 
authentication methods with Cascade.  The plugin itself is very simple 
as it relies on the web server to do the actual authentication. 

### Login flows

When users connect to Cascade, the module checks if the web server has 
already authenticated them.  If the user has authenticated, they are
passed to the customauth servlet which invokes the module's `authenticate`
method. In `authenticate`, the username of the authenticated user is extracted
and the user is logged into Cascade. The flow in this case is approximately:

    Apache (non-SSL) > CAS login > Cascade auth module's redirect() > Cascade auth module's auth() > Logged in

If during the login phase, not remote user is set, the user is forwarded to
the normal Cascade login screen. This is designed so that test users and web services 
users (who are not part of CAS) can login to Cascade without going through CAS
and instead authenticating against Cascade's internal password authentication.
In this case the flow is:

    Apache (SSL) > Cascade auth module's redirect() > Cascade login screen > Logged in

We have two virtual hosts set up in Apache -- one requires CAS (non-SSL)
authentication, and the other does not (SSL).  This lets us use CAS for regular 
users and use internal Cascade authentication for test accounts and web 
services.

### Apache and Tomcat

In our case, we run Apache in front of Tomcat, and do CAS authentication 
with the mod_auth_cas Apache authentication module.  I also have a 
couple of patches for that module that I can share if you are interested. 
If you don't use Apache, you can do authentication in Tomcat instead. 

### Installation/Usage

Before building the plugin, you need to change one line of the java 
source code. Line 41 currently reads:

     response.sendRedirect("http://my.cascadeserver.com/logout");

Change that to the logout URL for your environment. If your CAS supports Single Sign-Out,
this can be the logout service for CAS. If Single Sign-Out is not supported and the 
mod_auth_cas sessions need to be cleared first, this may be a script

To build the plugin, download the most recent authentication-x.x.jar file from 
Hannon Hill.

Next, set your java CLASSPATH to include this jar as well as Tomcat's 
servlet-api.jar file and run (be sure to compile with the same java version that
runs Cascade, or use the `-target` parameter to specify the correct version):

     javac remoteuserauth.java

Then, since the plugin says "package ca.usask.cascade", put the resulting 
class file in an equivalent directory and build a jar file: 

     mkdir org
     mkdir org/myorg
     mkdir org/myorg/cascade
     mv remoteuserauth.class org/myorg/cascade
     jar cf remoteuserauth.jar org/myorg/cascade/remoteuserauth.class

Now copy that jar file into your Cascade server's 
tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/ folder and restart Cascade.

Now login to Cascade, go into the Cascade Configuration/Custom 
Authentication screen and paste in this information: 

```xml
<custom-authentication-module>
    <class-name>org.myorg.cascade.RemoteUserAuth</class-name>
    <should-intercept-login-page>true</should-intercept-login-page>
</custom-authentication-module>
```

Finally, restart Cascade once more.

Note: If you are using ajp to communicate between Apache and Tomcat, you 
also need to specify tomcatAuthentication="false" to the AJP connector in 
your tomcat server.xml file.
